## Tasks

- **Note** for all these challenges we will not be using global variables and any standard library.
- We will be using function prototypes that will be included in our header file called, [holberton.h](./holberton.h).

---

0. [\_putchar](./0-holberton.c) : A C program that prints `Holberton`, followed by a new line.
	- The program should return `0`.
	- In this task we will be using prototype of funtion [\_putchar](./_putchar.c).
