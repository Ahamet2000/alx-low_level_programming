# C is FUN ðŸ˜Š

>Learning C right now, been wanting to get on this. It's going to be FUN !!.

## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [th3_gr00t](https://th33-gr00t.tk/).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

## Grit Notes

- Date: `7th July 2021` Time: `3:17 am`
	- Damn I am being overwhelmed, I want to remember this day.
	- I am thinking twice on not to sign the contract well it's in my prayers.
	- I am two projects behind alot of backlog.
		- They have released `0x08 while I am at 0x06`.
	- Currently on leave to rest, catch up with ALX while I think about the contract.
