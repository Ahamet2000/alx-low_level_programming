# C is FUN ðŸ˜Š

>Learning C right now, been wanting to get on this. It's going to be FUN !!.

## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [th3_gr00t](https://th33-gr00t.tk/).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

## Grit Notes

- Date: `7th July 2021` Time: `3:17 am`
	- Damn I am being overwhelmed, I want to remember this day.
	- I am thinking twice on not to sign the contract well it's in my prayers.
	- I am two projects behind alot of backlog.
		- They have released `0x08 while I am at 0x06`.
	- Currently on leave to rest, catch up with ALX while I think about the contract.
- Date: `12 July 2021` Time: `6:36 pm`
	- Damn I am still far, but I have managed to finish three projects.
	- Currently behind with `Recursion`, `Static Libraries` and `argc, argv`.
	- I am planning to jump to `argc, argv` before the deadline ends today, then work backwards.
	- Struggling abit here because I am unwell tested positive of Covid when I was on leave.
		- Good news is I have time to catch up before I get back to work.
	- Signed the contract btw.
- Date `14th July 2021` Time: `6:36 am`
	- Still playing catch up, managed to finish `argc, argv` now heading to `malloc, free`, then I do `static, libraries` then finish up with `recursions`.
	- Why am I getting late every single time because I am trying to understand the concepts being taught.
	- I am excited the changed the deadlines to **6am** which means I can try catching up today.
	- I am also excited to learn about `malloc` (*calloc*, *realloc*) and `free` today and how to use `valgrind` to find memory leaks.
